# MCB 419 - HW12 - Neural Q-Learning

## Introduction
This week we combine reinforcement learning with neural networks.
For this exercise, we will use a simple video game scenario, 
where the goal is to move a paddle left and right catch green pellets and avoid red pellets.

The important changes relative to hw11 are:
- the state space is now continuous, rather than discrete
- Q-values are estimated using a neural network, rather than a table


 We follow the general approach given in this week's reading assignment:

    Mnih V, et al. (2015) Human Level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning. Nature 518, 539-533</a>.

 We will use the neural net library and reinforcement learning module documented here:
