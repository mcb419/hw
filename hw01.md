## Introduction
In this assignment you will use p5js to create a single bot that moves around the arena in a circular path. The resulting simulation will look something like this:

## Specifications
The arena is 400 x 400 pixels.  
The bot is drawn as a yellow circle with a radius of 20 pixels.  
The bot has a solid line indicating its heading direction.

The bot's _initial_ conditions:  
**x**: 50 pixels from the right edge of the arena  
**y**: half way down the arena  
**heading**: facing the bottom of the arena 

The bot's movement:  
**speed**: the bot moves at a constant speed of 3 pixels/tick  
**heading**: on each tick, the heading should be incremented by a fixed amount,
then the bot should be moved by 3 units in that direction. The resulting change in x and y position are given by:  
dx = speed * cos(heading)  
dy = speed * sin(heading)   
**trajectory**: the bot should move along a circular path with a diameter of 300 pixels. This will be accomplished by incrementing the bot's heading direction by a fixed amount on each tick. You will need to compute the value for the amount to increment the heading. To do so, consider the following:
- what is the circumference of a cirlce with a diameter of 300 pixels?
- if the bot moves a 3 pixels per tick, how many ticks are required to move along the full circumference of the circle?
- when the bot completes the circle it's heading will have gone through a change of 2&pi; radians. Knowing the number of ticks required to complete the circle should let you calculate the change in heading per tick.

## Instructions
- **Open** the [template file](https://editor.p5js.org/mcb419/sketches/H1H-yWkGE) (right-click to open in a new tab)
 - **Login** to the p5js editor (so you can save changes)
- **Duplicate** the template (you now have a copy that you can edit and save)
- **Edit Bot.js** you will need to provide code for reset(), update() and draw()
- **Edit sketch.js** you will need to create the bot and call the reset, update and draw methods at appropriate locations in the code
- **Save** your changes
- **Repeat editing, debugging, saving** until things are working properly
- **Click "Check implementation" button** to test your code
- When you are finished, **copy & paste the url of your p5js project into an email message** and send the email to mcb419@gmail.com
